* form id is come from the id attribute in th element of DOM. 'form1234' became '1234';
* The link on the form name is reference document.
* If CDE has column 'Permissible Values', data type will be 'Value List'. Else column 'Data Type' is the CDE's data type.
* Column 'Input Restrictions' is the question mutiselect.
* Column 'Min Value' is the CDE data type 'Number' min.
* Column 'Max Value' is the CDE data type 'Number' max.
