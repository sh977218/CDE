Two objects are presented at a time. For each pair, the objects are either identical or mirror image reversals of each other. The participant\u0027s job is to determine as rapidly as possible whether the objects are the same (i.e., a copy that differs only in rotation angle) or different (i.e., mirror image objects). Whether mirrored or same, the two objects are displaced at various angles ranging from 5o to 305o in 60o steps. Some pairs will be the same image rotated, and others will be mirrored.",

The MACE is conducted up to 72 hours following an injury and only if alteration of consciousness or loss of consciousness is present. The evaluation consists of a history section, neurological evaluation, and a scored cognitive screen of orientation, immediate and delayed recall, and concentration. Alternate forms can be used to monitor recovery and aid in decisions about returning to duty. It is currently undergoing additional validation.",

The MACE is conducted up to 72 hours following an injury and only if alteration of consciousness or loss of consciousness is present. The evaluation consists of a history section, neurological evaluation, and a scored cognitive screen of orientation, immediate and delayed recall, and concentration. Alternate forms can be used to monitor recovery and aid in decisions about returning to duty. It is currently undergoing additional validation.",

The MACE is conducted up to 72 hours following an injury and only if alteration of consciousness or loss of consciousness is present. The evaluation consists of a history section, neurological evaluation, and a scored cognitive screen of orientation, immediate and delayed recall, and concentration. Alternate forms can be used to monitor recovery and aid in decisions about returning to duty. It is currently undergoing additional validation.",
