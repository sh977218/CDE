	"description": "Formerly the Frontal Lobe Personality Scale (FLOPS), the FrSBe was designed to identify and quantify behavioral problems associated with frontal lobe dysfunction. This scale assesses behavior related to frontal systems damage. It also quantifies behavioral changes over time by including both baseline (retrospective) and current assessments of behavior. Forms are available for both patient and family member to complete, with separate norms for each informant. There is potential for discrepancy between the information collected from the informant and the participant.",

As noted earlier, the examiner should remain available to answer any questions the patient or rater may have (regardless of any cognitive limitations they may have) as they complete the appropriate rating form. \n\nIt should be noted that there is a visual break on the second page of each rating form between  Items 32 and 33, along with the instruction  Read each of the following items carefully before responding.  This is to ensure that the rater is alert to the shift in item content, namely from items reflecting negative or maladaptive behaviors (Items 1-32) to items reflecting more positive or adaptive behaviors (Items 33-46). It is recommended that the examiner visually inspect the rater\u0027s responses to Items 33-46 to confirm that the pattern of ratings has changed in the appropriate direction. If it appears that the rater has not responded to these items in the expected direction, then the examiner should review with the rater his or her individual responses to these items.",

This scale assesses behavior related to frontal systems damage. It also quantifies behavioral changes over time by including both baseline (retrospective) and current assessments of behavior. Forms are available for both patient and family member to complete, with separate norms for each informant. There is potential for discrepancy between the information collected from the informant and the participant.",

As noted earlier, the examiner should remain available to answer any questions the patient or rater may have (regardless of any cognitive limitations they may have) as they complete the appropriate rating form. \n\nIt should be noted that there is a visual break on the second page of each rating form between  Items 32 and 33, along with the instruction  Read each of the following items carefully before responding.  This is to ensure that the rater is alert to the shift in item content, namely from items reflecting negative or maladaptive behaviors (Items 1-32) to items reflecting more positive or adaptive behaviors (Items 33-46). It is recommended that the examiner visually inspect the rater\u0027s responses to Items 33-46 to confirm that the pattern of ratings has changed in the appropriate direction. If it appears that the rater has not responded to these items in the expected direction, then the examiner should review with the rater his or her individual responses to these items.",

This questionnaire  will allow us to better understand (your or your relative\u0027s) behavior. You will be asked to rate the frequency of (your or his/her) behavior on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is Almost  never, 2 is Seldom, 3 is Sometimes, 4 is Frequently, and 5 is Almost always. You will be asked to rate (your or his/her) behavior at two points in time: before (your or his/her) illness, injury, or problems  began and at the present time, or after the illness or injury occurred. Be sure you complete both columns on the form since they are both important for measuring changes in (your or your relative\u0027s) behavior. Please read each of the phrases on the form that are used to describe a person\u0027s behavior. The questionnaire asks,  How often (do you or does your  relative) engage in the behavior described at each point in time?\u0027\u0027 Circle the number in each column, Before illness or injury and After illness or injury, that corresponds to your rating for the behavior described.",

Do not report a total score when a component is Not Testable because the score will be low and this could be confusing to medical colleagues.
