It does not include simple beliefs or ideas, such as that the subject is acting as an agent of God or that friends or parents are trying to coerce him to do something. Rather, the subject must describe, for example, that his body has been occupied by some alien force that is making it move in peculiar ways, or that messages are being sent to his brain by radio waves and causing him to experience particular feelings that he recognizes are not his own.\nHave you ever felt you were being controlled by some outside force?",

Things may be said in juxaposition which lack a meaningful relationship, or the subject may shift idiosyncratically from one frame of reference to another. At times there may be a vague connection between the ideas, and at others none will be apparent. This pattern of speech is often characterized as sounding  disjointed.  Perhaps the commonest manifestation of this disorder is a slow, steady slippage, with no single derailment being particularly severe, so that the speaker gets farther and farther off the track with each derailment without showing any awareness that his reply no longer has any connection with the question which was asked. This abnormality is often characterized by lack of cohesion between clauses and sentences and by unclear pronoun references.\nExample: Interviewer:  Did you enjoy college?  Subject:  Um-hum. Oh hey well, I oh, I really enjoyed some communities I tried it, and the, and the next day when I\u0027d be going out, you know, um, I took control like uh, I put, um, bleach on my hair in, in California.

It may take the form of faulty inductive inferences. It may also take the form of reaching conclusions based on faulty premises without any actual delusional thinking. \nExclusions: Illogicality may either lead to or result from delusional beliefs. When illogical thinking occurs within the context of a delusional system, it should be subsumed under the concept of delusions and not considered a separate phenomenon representing a different type of thinking disorder. Illogical thinking which is clearly due to cultural or religious values or to intellectual deficit should also be excluded.\nExample:  Parents are the people that raise you. Any thing that raises you can be a parent. Parents can be anything -- material, vegetable, or mineral -- that has taught you something. Parents would be the world of things that are alive, that are there. Rocks -- a person can look at a rock and learn something from it, so that would be a parent.",

It differs from derailment in that in incoherence the abnormality occurs within the level of the sentence or clause, which contains words or phrases that are joined incoherently. The abnormality in derailment involves unclear or confusing connections between larger units, such as sentences or clauses. This type of language disorder is relatively rare. When it occurs, it tends to be severe or extreme, and mild forms are quite uncommon. It may sound quite similar to Wernicke\u0027s aphasia or jargon aphasia, and in these cases the disorder should only be called incoherence when history and laboratory data exclude the possibility of a past stroke, and formal testing for aphasia is negative.\nExclusions: Mildly ungrammatical constructions or idiomatic usages characteristic of particular regional or ethnic backgrounds, lack of education, or low intelligence.\nExample: Interviewer:  What do you think about current political issues like the energy crisis?  Subject:  They\u0027re destroying too many cattle and oil just to make soap.

Code 1 would be appropriate whenever the ICECI Injury Activity Axis would be coded as  sports and exercise during leisure time  (ICECI Injury Activity code 4) regardless of coding on other ICECI Axes. Second priority is given to Assault. If the event did not involve sports but it did involve an assault, then the event should be coded as a 2 (Assault) regardless of whether it involved transport or a fall. Code 2 would be appropriate whenever the ICECI Intent of Injury Axis would be coded as  assault  (ICECI Intent of Injury code 3) and the ICECI Injury Activity Axis would not be coded as  sports and exercise during leisure time  (ICECI Injury Activity code 4) regardless of other ICECI Axes. Third priority is given to Transport. If the event was neither sports nor assault related but it involved transport, then the event should be coded as 3 (Transport) regardless of whether it involved a fall. Code 3 would be appropriate whenever the ICECI External Cause of Injury Axis would be coded as  transport injury event  (ICECI External Cause of Injury code 1.1) and ICECI Intent of Injury Axis would not be coded as  assault  (ICECI Intent of Injury code 3) and ICECI Injury Activity Axis would not be coded as  sports and exercise during leisure time  (ICECI Injury Activity code 4). Fourth priority is given to Fall. If the event was neither sports, assault nor transport related and it involved a fall then it should be coded as 4 (Fall). Code 4 would be appropriate whenever the ICECI External Cause of Injury Axis would be coded as  falling, stumbling, or jumping  (ICECI External Cause of Injury code 1.5) and ICECI Intent of Injury Axis would not be coded as  assault  (ICECI Intent of Injury code 3) and ICECI Injury Activity Axis would not be coded as  sports and exercise during leisure time  (ICECI Injury Activity code 4). Use code 5 (other traumatic cause) for all other known (specified) traumatic causes whenever codes 1 through 4 of this etiology variable do not apply. Paralysis secondary to surgical procedures when the patient does not have a neurological deficit prior to surgery would be coded in this category. Use code 6 (non-traumatic cause) if there is impairment of the spinal cord or cauda equina function that is not caused either directly or indirectly by an external event.",

Although guidelines are often expressed in terms of a total GCS ҳcore,Ҡthe trend in whichever of the components (eye, motor or verbal) can be assessed is still valuable. \n2. Do not use number ѱҠto record missing component; use ҎTҠ(Not testable). \n3. Do not report a total score when a component is Not Testable because the score will be low and this could be confusing to medical colleagues. This may also imply that the patient is more unwell than they actually are. \n4. It is possible using statistical methods to estimate a missing component from the findings in the other components.
