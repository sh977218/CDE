Do not use number ѱҠto record missing component; use ҎTҠ(Not testable). \n3. Do not report a total score when a component is Not Testable because the score will be low and this could be confusing to medical colleagues.

Do not use number ѱҠto record missing component; use ҎTҠ(Not testable). \n3. Do not report a total score when a component is Not Testable because the score will be low and this could be confusing to medical colleagues.

Do not report a total score when a component is Not Testable because the score will be low and this could be confusing to medical colleagues.

Do not report a total score when a component is Not Testable because the score will be low and this could be confusing to medical colleagues.
