The CES-D queries a patient\u0027s depression symptoms in the last week, with each question is scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (rarely/none of the time) to 3 (most/all of the time). Scores for items 4, 8, 12, and 16 are reversed before summing all items to yield a total score. A score of 16 or higher has been used to indicate highly depressive symptoms.",
