<h2>User Profile</h2>
A registered account will be able to view his profile. In particular, he will be able to see a history of CDEs previously viewed. 

<h2>Finding CDEs</h2>
Below is a screenshot to show a sample search for CDEs: <br/>
<img src="/help/public/img/search1.png" alt="Screenshot of search page"/>
<ul>
    <li>Filters can be applied to narrow down a query.</li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>Filter on Stewards' Classification</li>
            <li>Filter on Registration Status</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
All terms will be searched for. The search result will return CDEs where any of the term can be found. Priorities are given to CDEs where:
<ul>
    <li>The search criteria is matched on name, or definition.</li>
    <li>The status of the CDE is high</li>
    <li>All terms are matched</li>
    <li>The terms are close to one another</li>
</ul> 
To force a term to be matched, it can be prepended with + <br/>
For example, 'Family +Income" will only match on CDEs that match the word income. <br/>
Quotes can also be added to ensure that terms appear as a phrase. <br/>

<h2>Roles</h2>
There are 4 roles in the CDE application.
<h3>Public User</h3>
Public users can browse the site, search and view CDES.
<h3>Registered Users</h3>
In addition to public user privileges, a registered user can create boards and add comments. 
<h3>Curators</h3>
In addition to registered user privileges, a curator can create CDEs, edit CDEs owned by his steward and manage the classification tree for his steward. 
<h3>Admins</h3>
In addition to curator privileges, an admin can promote/demote other users to be admin or curator for his steward. 

<h2>Classifications</h2>

<h2>Managing a Steward</h2>
When accounts are given administrator (admin) privilege, they are able to manage an organization. 
If you have an admin account, the user name menu in the upper right corner will bring down an "Account Management" option. 
<br/>
From the account management page, you may add other users as administrators or curators. 
Other administrator will also be able to add or remove administrators and curators, while curators will only be able to manage CDEs.
