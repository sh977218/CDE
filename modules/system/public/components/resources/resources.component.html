        Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)
        The VSAC is a repository and authoring tool for public value sets created by external programs. Value sets are
        lists of codes and corresponding terms, from NLM-hosted standard clinical vocabularies (such as SNOMED CT速,
        RxNorm, LOINC速 and others), that define clinical concepts to support effective and interoperable health
        information exchange. The VSAC does not create value set content. The VSAC also provides downloadable access to
        all official versions of value sets specified by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) electronic
        Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs). For information on CMS eCQMs, visit the eCQI Resource Center. The VSAC is
        provided by the National Library of Medicine (NLM), in collaboration with the Office of the National Coordinator
        for Health Information Technology (ONC) and CMS.
